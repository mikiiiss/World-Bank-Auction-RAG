directors lds in sdf. planning should t ake into account longterm st rategies for efficiency , and cost effectiveness and optimum uses of resources . procurement planning reduces the number of emergency orders and results in low er purchase costs and imp roved service delivery. such planning should also take into consid eration the information n eeds of the supp ly chain, from initi ation th rough delivery, on a holistic basis. e ffective procurement planning, or the lack of it, has a very definite impact on the overall schedule of sdf and the attainment of their goals and objectives.

the mandatory procurement reviews per the ppa 2006 and ppr 2008. this review shall be carried out by an ind ependent external auditor or reviewer appointed by the sdf. the findin gs of the review shall be provided to the sdfmof bfid , the central procurement technical unit cptu, and the wb. in addition to the annual mandatory reviews, the director  finance  procurement may condu ct internal management reviews with the objective of strengthening processes wherever deficiencies are found. the overall objectives of any procurement review will b e  establish the existence of documentation suppo rting the procurement system  evaluate and assess the adequacy of internal controls  examine compli ance with p rescribed procurement procedures and tender law  ensu re that funds p rovided for procurement are spent efficiently  report on w eaknesses identified during the review  make recomm endations for improvements 2.8 produ ct quality assurance good qu ality goods, works and services are a critical factor in safeguarding the interest of sdf . poor quality are unlik ely to fulfill their purpose of organizational objectives . in wo rstcase scenarios, th ey can be detrimental to reputation of the organization . besides procuring from reliable and qu ality suppli ers, appropriate pre and post shipment insp ection and su rveillance of the goods th roughout the delivery, customs clearance, warehousin g, and dist ribution processes are impo rtant to m ake sure that products of the right quality are procured and that the quality is maintained through good storage and dist ribution p ractices. once in the distribution system, reliable monito ring of expiry dates and sto rage conditions as well as recognizing and responding to product defects and adverse reactions are critical. 2.8.1 produ ct quality assurance during the bidding process ensu ring product quality is an essential compon ent of the procurement process. it is achieved through appropriate selection of commoditi es, preparing comprehensive technical specifications terms of referencedescription of service and by procuring from qu alified manufacturers whose product quality and good m anufacturing practices have been confirmed by reputed ind ependent sources suppo rted by appropriate certifications for good m anufacturing practices, in conformity with the provisions of the who certification s cheme for goods moving in int ernational comm erce.4 the quality standards and certifications required by sdf for the submis sion of a bid sh all be specified in the biddi ng document. it will be the responsibili ty of the tscs and 4 httpwww.who.intmedicinesareasquality_safetyregulation_legislationcertificationguidelinesenindex.html 8 chapter 2 gene ral policies and guidance tecspecs to check this documentation and ensure only bids complying with the requirements are consid ered during bid evaluation. 2.8.2 preshipm ent inspection and t esting product quality assurance can be facilitated by preshipm ent qu ality inspection and testing. this insp ection and certification usu ally covers quality, quantity, and reasonableness of price. imports procured through competitive bidding processes shall not be subject to p rice verification, but on ly verification for quality and quantity. as per the list of the national board of revenue, sdf shall retain the services of reputable, independent, preshipm ent insp ection agencies to condu ct visu al insp ections andor testing of all consignments m eant for sdf prior to shipm ent. in the event that a preshipm ent qu ality check indi cates that all or some of the batches have failed to m eet quality standards, sdf will not accept the batches in qu estion and m ay reject the entire consignment. bidding do cuments for all procurements sh all contain provisions indi cating that the sdf shall require pre shipm ent inspections of all consignments. 2.8.3 postshipm ent in spection and t esting all goods received by sdf shall be subjected to postshipm ent insp ection to ensure conformity to required quality and technical specifications. this post shipm ent process may involve visual insp ection andor laboratory testing of samples. in visu al insp ection, incoming commoditi es are critically examined for obvious quality defects and for conformity to product specifications m ention ed in t ender documents. visu al insp ection should be carried out by a standing board. a numb er of tests can be performed at the time of receipt to assure quality of the products received. ho wever, doing laboratory testing on a routine basis is expensive and time consumin g. hence, in p ractice, it is impo rtant to d ecide what specific products should be tested and how o ften. a tw ostage sampling technique may be used in which a small sample is examined and a second, larger sample is drawn and insp ected only in the event the first sample fails visu al insp ection. postshipm ent laboratory testing should not be used as a routine procedure. it should be done selectively, for example, when products are purchased from a new suppli er or when it is decided that a particular supp ly or selected batches of a supp ly should be subjected to post  shipm ent qu ality testing if there is reason to doubt the quality of the supp ly. if sdf undertakes post shipm ent qu ality testing of one or more batches, steps should be taken to isol ate all the stock in qu estion and not dist ribute it until the test report is received and the products  services is reported to comply with the quality standards sp ecified in the sdf bidding documents. if products  services fail testing, sdf should t ake action to s ecure fresh suppli es from the manufacturers free of charge as specified in the tender documentation. t he failed products  services should be quarantined and separated from oth er stock. the bid do cumentation should also contain a clause that clearly states that the company that suppli es failed products  services will be responsible for removing th em from the sdf warehouse within a stipul ated tim e. it is impo rtant that the bid documentation clearly states the requirements for pre and post  shipm ent insp ections so that all prospective bidders are properly aware of these conditions. 9 sdf procurement procedures manual 2.9 procurement portfolios the procurement po rtfolios handled by the director  finance  procurement include  equipm ent, and other commoditi es that may be required from time to tim e. 2.10 materials standardization the use of open, competitive bidding procedures in publi cly funded procurement can be streamlined and, in p articular, special attention p aid to the developm ent of specifications to help achieve some of the benefits available through st andardization wh erever possibl e. 2.11 materials specifications the specifications for an item should be based on the general purpose for which the item is intended and not on ly upon the design, cost, or quality. it is p articularly important to avoid the use of brand names in material specifications. where unavoidable, the phrase or equivalent should be used. a performance or generic specification gives a clear idea of the function, application, and performance required of the suppli ed goods or services. from s uch specifications, su ppliers can often provide new, improved, or cheaper solutions. a conformance or particular specification restricts the suppli er to providing the actual article as physically described. any of these could be used when necessary. specifications must be clearly, accurately, and completely drawn so as to leave no doubt in the suppli ers mind as to wh at the purchaser requires. unn ecessarily restrictive requirements, which may undu ly limit the numb er of bidders, shall be avoided. specifications sh all be drawn up by the individu al lds responsible for managing different productsservices in collaboration with p rocurement desk officers. where appropriate, assistance must be sought from technical experts to ensure preparation of the correct specifications. 2.11.1 materials specifications database the director  finance  procurement shall develop a database of material specifications th at shall be regularly updated to ensure accuracy and reliability. such a database will b ecome an inv aluable management tool for facilitating the objectives of the supp ly process und er the sector, i.e., efficiency, economy, and transparency without s acrificing quality. developm ent of the database may comm ence with the specifications of the last procurement package for individu al items approved by the wb with respect to pool fundfunded procurement. 2.12 samples requiring submission of samples along with the bids should be discouraged. normally no samples should be requested, and decisions on award should be made based on m erit of the bid and bidding qualifications. in exception al cases when submission of samples is justi fied, because of high risks and quality assurance reasons, the bidding documents should id entify this circumst ance and require the successful bidd er to provide samples for tests before award, allowing a reasonable time for such submission. how ever, the procedures and details of tests to be condu cted should be specified and results of tests obt ained within a reasonable time of 10 chapter 2 gene ral policies and guidance about two w eeks. for such items, bidd ers should be required to submit, along with th eir bids, test results condu cted in a recognized laboratory. if the samples fail pursuant to t ests condu cted by the purchaser, bidd ers will be notified of the discrepancies and items of failure, accompanied by test reports, will be returned to t he bidder. 2.13 prospective bidd ers 2.13.1 sourcing prospective bidd ers one of the greatest challenges within a procurement organization is establishing specifications and reliable competitive sources for goods. sources of prospective bidders include 1. n ewspapers and publi cations p rospective bidders and m anufacturers can apply for placement on a prospective bidders list 2. invitation to t ender for specific requirements via the media 3. t rade directories and reference manuals provided by specific indust ries 4. t rading organizations, chambers of comm erce, embassiescomm ercial attaches, and other simil ar organizations 5. local trade fairs and exhibitions m anufacturers brochures can be collected for future study and analysis 6. oth er procurement managers and contacts in lo cal and foreign institutions 7. internet searches 2.13.2 evaluation of prospective bidd ers a numb er of steps m ay be undertaken wh en evaluating prospective bidders, including formal bidder registration by sdf, reference checks with previous custom ers, the purchase of sm all quantities for trial or testing, and formal and informal information collection. when pot ential bidders have been located and id entified, the next step is to evaluate their suitability for inclusion. the prospective bidder may be required to compl ete a bidder information form annex 1. prospective bidders may be evaluated by a process of pre or postqualification. in the case of prequalification, the process is simi lar to an open tender with the main difference that quantities required are not indi cated, because the objective is to id entify prospective bidders who are qualified to supp ly a particular item. a ctual procurement may then be done by calling for prices from only the prequalified bidders for specific quantities. a prequalification is und ertaken well before the actual procurement. in the case of post qualification, relevant sections of the information required on the bidder information form shall be
